          <p>I'm only seventeen and as such have learned far more lessons in programming and project development than products I have completed or than 
            <mark>anything useful that I've done. </mark>With the small amount of time that I have been in a position to produce and project myself in a direction, independent of anyone else I have learned a great deal.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>I have chosen to develop myself into a person with a flexible mindset, hungry for new and more relevant knowledge whilst retaining a wide range of abilities. Subsequently, I am also one to work continuously, self sustained on the problem at hand. With this, I am eager to come to work with others more often and collaborate with others in order to begin paying back into my time spent here.</p>
