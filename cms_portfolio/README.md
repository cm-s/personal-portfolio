##This is the rails app for my portfolio
This application uses **_Ruby 2.3.1_** patch 112 (ruby 2.3.1p112) along with **_Rails 4.2.6_**
This version does not include any dependencies other than the defaults;
* sqlite3
* sass-rails ~> 5.0
* uglifier >= 1.3.0
* jquery-rails
* turbolinks
* jbuilder ~> 2.0
* sdoc ~> 0.4.0
* byebug (for test and development environments)
* web-console ~> 2.0 (for development environments only)
* spring (for development environments only)

Since this application is in very early stages, running the WEBrick server encompasses all that I have done.

Changes in the upgrade from the third iteration of my site to this one include the following:
* renovation of the background for the index page
* Changes to to the first section (of three), Now talking about my work instead of myself
* The button to navigate to the top of the page now scrolls smoothly
* Page markup has been converted to raw HTML and now implements embedded ruby mechanisms
* The styles for the index page have been further optimized for performance and scalability
