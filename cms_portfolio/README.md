##This is the rails app for my portfolio
This application uses **_Ruby 2.3.1_** patch 112 (ruby 2.3.1p112) along with **_Rails 4.2.6_**
This version does not include any dependencies other than the defaults;
* sqlite3
* sass-rails ~> 5.0
* uglifier >= 1.3.0
* jquery-rails
* turbolinks
* jbuilder ~> 2.0
* sdoc ~> 0.4.0
* byebug (for test and development environments)
* web-console ~> 2.0 (for development environments only)
* spring (for development environments only)

Since this application is in very early stages, running the WEBrick server encompasses all that I have done.

All changes to my personal portfolio will most likely be on this application
Log of current implemented/transitioned features is organized below;
###Material Messenger
* User database
* Card-style sign up page
* Sliding side menu
