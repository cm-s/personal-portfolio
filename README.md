## This is the root of my own personal portfolio
This project has eventually become a Rails application. A list of upgrades and changes is located in the README of the cms_portfolio folder, being the root of the application.

Older iterations of this project are located in the iterations folder and organized retrospectively. The lower the iteration, the older it is. This is also how the branches of this repository are organized. The exception being that the branches correspond to past rails versions the application(`cms_portfolio`) had been left off in.
